# Data Visualization with Plotly for Python (Jupyter Notebook)
*In-person workshop originally held at NYU Shanghai on October 22, 2021. Designed and delivered by Pamela Pan (@pamela-pan)*

This repository serves as a documentation of the workshop. In this workshop, we walked through the demo dataset in the Plotly graphing library, which is provided by Gapminder data. It is a dataset about global health between 1952-2007, and we will use it to make different interactive graphs.

Here is a preview of the project.
